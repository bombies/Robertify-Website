## What To Do First?

First things first is to join any voice channel and start playing music. You can easily accomplish this by running the `/play tracks` command. It's as simple as that, Robertify is now ready for you to control.

You can then move on to having your life be made easier by creating a request channel. You can create a request channel by running the `/setup` or `/requestchannel create` command. Once you do that, a request channel will be created and you can easily control your player.

    Searching and loading tracks by typing just the name/link in the request channel doesn't work for now.
