# Logging

Robertify provides an interface that allows for every interaction between the player and a user to be logged to a specific channel.
<Callout type='info'>
    You can toggle which logs are to be sent in the log channel. More information on that will be talked about in the [toggles](/docs/toggles#log-toggles) section.

## Command Setup

In order to set this up you can either run the `/setuplogs` command to create a new channel dedicated for logging, or, you can run the
`/setlogchannel` to set the log channel to an existing channel.
