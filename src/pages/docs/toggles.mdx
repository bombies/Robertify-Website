# Toggles

There are quite a lot of features in Robertify, and instead of forcing you and all your users to use them you are given
the means to disable certain features and limit access to certain commands.

## The Main Toggles

There are a few fundamental toggles. Details can be seen in the table below.

| Toggle            | Description                                                                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## DJ Toggles

DJ toggles define which audio commands should be DJ-only or not. This means that once a command is set to DJ-only, only DJs
will be able to execute that command. To toggle a DJ-only command, you must execute the command `/toggles dj switch` with the command
name as the argument

To view the status of your DJ toggles you must execute the `/toggles dj list` command.
