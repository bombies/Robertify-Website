# Permissions

Robertify has its own permission system where each member or role in your server can have a specific permission.

<Callout type='warning'>
    It goes without saying that everything in this section is **admin-only**.

## Managing Permissions

You can manage permissions by using the `/permissions` command. However, there are other commands to simplify the process.

### The `Permissions` Command

#### Role Permissions

Adding a permission to a role can be done with the `/permissions add role` command with the `role` and the `permission` as arguments.
For example, if I want to add `ROBERTIFY_ADMIN` to my `Admin` role the command would be `/permissions add role Admin ROBERTIFY_ADMIN`.

<Callout type='info'>
    If you are a server admin you will already have access to the `ROBERTIFY_ADMIN` permission.

#### User Permissions

Adding a permission to a user is similar to adding a permission to a role. The command that is to be used is the `/permission add user` command with the `user` and the `permission` as arguments.
With Discord's slash commands, it's made easier than ever to select a user. All you have to do is enter their username and select them from the list provided.

#### Removing Permissions

You can remove a permission by executing the `/permissions remove role` or `/permissions remove user` commands with role `role` or `user` as the argument.

#### Listing Permissions

You can list all permissions granted to each role/user by executing the `/permissions list permissions` command. You can then narrow this down by running the `/permissions list role` or `/permissions list user` command.

### The DJ Command

The `setdj`, `listdj` and `removedj` commands are dedicated to managing DJ roles and users. It makes it easier to set your users as DJs or not.

For the `setdj` and `removedj` there are two sub commands; `role` and `user`.
Meaning, if you would like to set a new DJ role you would run the command `/setdj role` with the role being the argument. The same would apply to removing a DJ.
The `listdj` command requires so additional subcommand or argument.
