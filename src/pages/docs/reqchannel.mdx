# The Request Channel

The request channel is the control panel for your player. From here you can have a dedicated channel that is kept clean to allow you to:
- Play music
- Control the player (Skip, pause, rewind tracks, disconnect the bot, etc...)
- Easily set favourite tracks
- Easily toggle filters

<Callout type='error'>
    Playing tracks by simply entering the link/name as a raw message in the request channel isn't supported with Robertify anymore. We are in the progress of restoring this feature.

## Setup

Setting up the request channel takes minimal effort. You can do this through Discord or the [dashboard](https://robertify.me/dashboard).

### Through Discord

Setting up the request channel through discord can be done by running the `/setup` or `/requestchannel setup` command.
This will create a channel titled `robertify-requests` at the top of your channel list. From this point you can move, rename and edit the permissions of the channel for other users.

<Callout type='warning'>
    Robertify **MUST** have access to the `Manage Channels` permission in order to create a request channel in your server.

## Using the Request Channel

Using the request channel is as simple as clicking the buttons provided for you. The only time you have to touch your keyboard is when you want to play new music.

The request channel buttons in sequential order are as follows:
### Previous

This buttons plays the previous track immediately.

### Rewind

This button rewinds the currently played track to the beginning.

### Play and Pause

This button resumes or pauses the currently played track.

### Stop

This button stops the currently played track and clears the queue.

### Skip

This buttons skips the currently played track.

### Add Favourite Track

This button adds the currently played track as a personal favourite song.

### Loop Track / Queue

This button loops the track or queue. The cycle is as follows:
- Loop Track
- Loop Queue
- Disable loop

Meaning on first click (loop disabled), the currently playing track will be looped. Another click will invoke the current queue being looped and disables the loop for the current track. Another click will disable looping in general.

### Shuffle

This button shuffles the current queue.

### Disconnect

This button disconnects the bot.
