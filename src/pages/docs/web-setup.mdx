## Using the Website

Since you've found your way to this documentation, you must know about the [website](https://robertify.me). The website's dashboard is just another interface to allow for the control of Robertify.
You can easily access the dashboard for your server by following these steps:

## Logging In

- Click on the "Login" button in the top-right of the navigation bar. If you're on a mobile device it will be at the bottom of the navigation menu.
- You will be routed to a Discord authorization page, where will click "Authorize" to allow Robertify to access your account's metadata.
<Callout type='warning'>
    Robertify doesn't collect or store any metadata retrieved from this authorization method. We do not collect your password of any sorts and there are no means for us to access your account. We are only able to verify that you are truly the Discord user you claim to be.

- Once you have authorized your account, you will be redirected back to the website where you can now see your username and avatar. In order to access your server list, click on your username then click on the "Servers" button.

- You will then be routed to your server list, which will tell you exactly which servers you can modify.

## Accessing and Using the Server Dashboard

- Once you're in your server list, you can click on a server you own or are an admin in to go to the dashboard.
- From here, you can change whatever features or add whatever you'd like.
- Once you have editing the settings to your liking, ensure to click the save button so your changes will actually be synced with the bot.

    - If you try to access a server that Robertify isn't in, the website will automatically prompt you to invite the bot before continuing. After a successful invitation, you will be re-routed back to the dashboard.
    - If you try to access a server that you are not an admin in that Robertify is in, you will not be allowed to interact with the dashboard.
