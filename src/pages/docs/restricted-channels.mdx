# Restricted Channels

Restricted channels provide, as the name suggests, restricted access to the bot. Meaning commands and/or features
will only be available in channels you configure.

<Callout type='info'>
    Server admins and users with the `ROBERTIFY_ADMIN` permission will still be able to use commands anywhere and have the bot join whichever channel.
</Callout>

## Updating Restricted Channels

<Callout type='warning'>
    Before setting restricted voice or text channels you should ensure the `restrictedvoice` or `restrictedtext` toggle is enabled.
    You can read more about how to do that [here](/docs/toggles#the-main-toggles).
</Callout>

You can set restricted channels by running the `/restricted channels add` command with the `channel` as the argument.
Upon doing this, it will be made that Robertify will only be allowed to join the channel you set. You can set as many channels as you'd like.

You can remove a restricted voice channel by running the `/restricted channels remove` command with the `channel` as the argument.

You can list all your restricted voice channels by running the `/restricted channels list` command.

<Callout type='info'>
    This command works for both message and audio channels.
</Callout>
