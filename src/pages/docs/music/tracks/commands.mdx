## Playing Music

As mentioned earlier, you can start playing music with the `/play tracks` command. This command allows you to provide either a link or song name as the parameter.

### Adding Tracks to the Top of the Queue

You can easily add tracks to the top of the queue by running the `/play nexttracks` command. This works in the exact way the `/play tracks` command works, with the difference being the position the requested song is queued. With the regular play command, all newly request tracks will be added to the end of the queue whereas with the `nexttracks` subcommand all tracks will be added to the front.

    - This command is able to be restricted to a certain group of users/roles, along with every other audio command. The details of this will be covered in the [permissions section]().
    - This command works for links of all sorts. (Tracks, albums, playlists, etc...)

## Shuffle Play

You can automatically load your playlists shuffled by running the `/shuffleplay` command. This differs from the regular `/play`, which loads tracks from your playlist in sequential order.
