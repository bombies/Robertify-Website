# Track Searching

## The Search Command

If you aren't satisfied with a result Robertify automatically selects based on your query, you can choose the exact song from a list of search results fetched for you. The command to run a search query is, big surprise, the `search` command. All you have to provide is your desired query and select from the options provided. Once you select an option, Robertify will automatically add the selected song to the queue.
