# Now Playing

## Seeing What's Currently Playing

Robertify will automatically tell you when a new song has started playing in the channel where the most recent `play` command was ran. There is also the `/nowplaying` command which allows you to see the song being currently played, as well as the duration and how far into the song you are.
