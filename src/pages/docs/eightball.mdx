# 8 Ball

Robertify's 8 Ball is a simple addition but can be quite fun to interact with.
All you have to do is ask the bot a question with the command `/8ball ask` with the question you want to ask as the argument.
The bot will then respond with a default response or a custom response if you have set some up.
