# Ban Users

If someone is abusing the bot in your server there isn't a need to worry. 
You can ban them from using the bot with the `ban` command. You can unban them with the `unban` command.

## Banning Users

As was said above, you can ban a user using the `ban` command. This command accepts the `user` as the required argument.
You can provide an optional duration for the ban. For example, if I would like to ban the user NaughtyUser#0000 **permanently** I would run the
following command.

```txt
> /ban NaughtyUser#0000
```

If I would like to ban the user NaughtyUser#0000 for **1 day**, I would run the following command.

```txt
> /ban NaughtyUser#0000 1d
```

## Unbanning Users

You can unban a user using the `unban` command. This command accepts the `user` as the required argument.
