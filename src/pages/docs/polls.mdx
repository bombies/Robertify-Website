Robertify includes its own polls feature where you can create polls for your community to vote on. 

## Starting a Poll

You can start a poll by running the `polls` command and providing a question as the required argument.
You are able to provided up to 9 different choices and an optional duration. So, for example, if you would like
to start a poll asking the question with 3 choices and ends in 12 hours the command would be:

```txt
> /polls [question]:What is love? [choice1]:Baby don't hurt me [choice2]:Don't hurt me [choice3]:No more [duration]:12h
```
